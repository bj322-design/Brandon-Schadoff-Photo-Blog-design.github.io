		<p><u><b>Gallery Questions:</u></b></p><p>Morayama's approach to photography is interesting. He often uses differing techniques of lack of color, camera shake, and sharp imagery to focus on his subjects</p><p>The way in which he photographs people is unnatural in the photgraphy world. He tries to catch his subjects off guard. He expresses their shock and true emotions in his work.</p><p><u><b>Artist:</u></b> Daido Moriyama</p><p><b><u>Time Period:</u></b> 1974 New York</p><p>This photo depicts how someone can work in TV devlopment and also enjoy it in their freetime</p><p>It does this by showing the contrast between the CBS camera operator with the image of the feet infront of a TV in a home.</p><p>The focus of these two contrasting shots is clear. The first being the operator and the second being the feet of the person watching the TV from their home.</p><p> I don’t think anymore context needed to fully understand it. This starkly contrasts with the experience of the individual who works in the TV industry but still finds pleasure in indulging in it.</p><p> The style is different from anything I have seen before showing a clear depiction of a persons feet.</p>

		<p><u><b>Artist:</u></b> Daido Moriyama</p><p><b><u>Time Period:</u></b> 1972 To Present</p><p>This photo belongs to Daido Moriyama’s Record series, which he began in 1972 and continues today.</p><p>It depicts an ashy cigarette on a dirty ashtray, emphasizing the unglamorous and disgusting nature of smoking.</p><p>The focus of the image is sharp ultimately drawing your eyes to the dirty tray onto which the cigarette lies.</p><p>The image is simple and clear, conveying the artist’s message without needing more information. This image reminds me of the images I would expect to see in a health class in school to discourage smoking of children as they grow up.</p>

		<p>I selected this initial photograph as it encapsulates a memorable moment from my first two weeks.</p><p>In the image, two of my friends and flatmates stand on the ice, while local boys playfully toss crystal clear ice chunks into the frozen pond at Regent Park.</p><p>This image holds significance for me because, shortly after stepping onto the ice, a diverse crowd—comprising of adults, children, and couples—gathered around us. Some joined in breaking the ice, while others glided across the small pond. This experience taught me that, regardless of our differences, we can all come together for moments of joy, transcending boundaries and fostering connections.</p>

		<p>The second photograph I have chosen is significant to me as it was a night I will never forget.</p><p>In walking down the streets of Soho with my friends, we stumbled upon a crowd of people outside of a new store. We asked a person from the crowd what was happening. They said they were having a party for a fashion store opening. The stranger turned out to have taken part in organizing it and invited us in, also being from New York he wanted to show us a night we won't forget.</p><p>They have turned basement into a nightclub with a DJ and dancing. It proved to me that you never know what is going to happen in this city.</p><p>This image depicts a woman dancing under the disco ball with neon pink and purple lights all around her. I tried to make the focus of the image not of the woman, but the disco ball she is under. I wanted to try and capture the emotions I felt in that moment: chaoticness, and estatic.</p>

		<p>The third image I've selected depicts a long exposure image of me on London Bridge at night.</p><p>Being from New York, I am accustomed to the intense energy that characterizes a bustling city. However, London offers a different emotion.</p><p>In this image, I stand as the central figure, holding my composure amidst the rapid movement of the world around me. London, I have found to be an overwhelming experience. Though it is a city that I have over these two weeks, learned to love for all its beauty.</p><p>I am extremely thankful to call this bustling city my home away from home for the semester, as it continues to surprise me with its unique blend of, culture, architecture, history, and charm.</p>

		<p><p><u><b>Artist:</u></b> Jo Spence and Rosy Martin</p><p><b><u>Time Period:</u></b> 1989</p><p>This series by Jo Spence and Rosy Martin named, “Libido Uprising”, features two images: one of Spence armed with a hoover, and another of her wearing fishnet stockings and heels with the vacuum tube coiled up her leg. The first image is symbolizing the role of a housewife while the second is symbolizing the role of a seductress.</p><p>The photographer has made several technical choices:</p><p>Framing: Each image is individually framed, isolating the two roles and emphasizing their distinctness.</p><p>Focus: The focus is on Spence and the hoover in both images, drawing attention to the roles she is performing.</p><p>POV: The point of view is straightforward, allowing the viewer to directly engage with the images.</p><p>Shapes: The shapes of the hoover and Spence’s body in different poses contribute to the narrative of each image.</p><p>Use of Light: The images are brightly colored, creating a stark contrast with the dark background and highlighting the subjects.</p><p>Use of Colour: The use of colour further emphasizes the contrast between the two roles Spence is portraying.</p><p>What unites these images as a series is the theme of challenging female stereotypes. Both images depict the same individual, Spence, performing two clichéd roles that women are often expected to fulfill: the housewife and the seductress. This juxtaposition of roles in the series provides a critique of societal expectations and norms. The use of the same prop, the hoover, in both images also unifies them, serving as a symbol of domesticity that is both embraced and subverted. The series is a powerful commentary on gender roles and societal expectations.</p>

		<p>All the three shots show a different emotion in the images not only in how the subject looks but also how we interact with and interpret the images and feelings from them. The subject stands out more in some – such as the “worm’s eye”. However, they seem to look smaller or rather ‘less powerful’ as stated prior in the “birds’ eye”.</p>

	<p><b1>Week 3: Paul Trevor’s <i>Brick Lane: The Turning Point</i></b1>
</div>
<div id = content>
	<div id = text>
		<p>This image was achieved through a wider aperture. The artist was most likely using a f5.6 due to having the foreground in focus while the background has a slight Bokeh effect.</p><p>In this image he was most likely using a 35mm film camera due to the shape of the image being more rectangular and time in which these images were taken. He is shooting this image just to the left of the speaker causing the debate. He used the arch of the people in the crowd to make your eye travel to the middle of the image then upwards towards the woman raising her hand in the crowd. The light in the image is overhead and behind the photographer due to the shadow of the people in the background of the image being darker while the people in the foreground are exposed properly.</p><p>I feel that the fact he took the photo having the people in the front seeming almost bored or annoyed whilst having the people in the back and middle seeming to be very interested in the debate leads to the overall message in many white people didn't want this change to occur in Britain. The people in the back and middle seem to be mainly minorities while the people in the front are mainly white.</p><p>In the collection the artist depicts events that documented the events and people affected by the Battle of Brick Lane. The abstract meaning in these images to me shows how hysteria and hate against minorities affects us all. This becomes plane to see when looking at the image depicted on the right or other images in his collection of minority protests, or the fearful face of the white man holding a rosary during a preaching on the street.</p><p>Throughout his collection Paul Trevor uses a wider aperture to focus on his subjects and further show his message. In addition, he showed some shots involving a slower shutter leading to light trails from boys running down an alley to show how fast these events were happening. The shapes in these images always have leading lines be it from the streets, buildings, or people depicted. These lines help to frame the image and make the subject more known to the viewer. I feel what unites these images is the determination on the people's faces throughout the images. The people depicted often didn't show fear and when they did it was in the face of the preacher wanting to stay to tradition.</p><p>I feel that the descriptions shown do change my option of the collection as from an outside perspective I can further put myself in the right mindset to understand the events occurring. Without them I would have still understood the message, however it becomes more defined and concrete.</p><p>This collection was successful due to showing the message the people wanted to get out to the world and show the oppression they faced. Without the collection the oppression might have never stopped how it did and might have been worse for all involved parties.</p>

Everything in this image is exposed and this is seen when looking in the background in which you can see another women sitting down as well detail in the room itself.</p>

		<p>In the first photo I wanted to create a cozy atmosphere. That is why I chose to shoot this one them with wood paneling in the background and with warmer light unlike the second image. In all three photos I tried to use a smaller aperture being no more than f6.3.</p><p>This first photo I wanted to create a standard portrait involving my partner. I wanted to make something you might think is a pleasing image with the subject smiling.</p>

		<p>I wanted to change the tone for the second and third images slightly. In the second image she is seen staring off at the window. She looks distraught and concerned. </p><p>She was quickly moving her head leading to a slight blur in her face and hair. I wanted to change the tone from a warmer tone to concerned.</p><p>I believe that photography can capture a moment and this moment for her was worried and concerned about getting this assignment done. A human worry that I felt I wanted to capture. This image is unique as the background is white with the light being a soft diffused light illumining her whole body evenly.</p>

		<p>This third image I chose uses a similar theme to the second image that is juxtaposed with the wood paneling. In this image, like the first, the lighting is very little from overhead the subject.</p><p>Her face is again concerned with a  slight smirk this time. This image is unlike the three because it paints the cozy theme as stated before with the darker theme of the second image, human concern. All three image are alike due to the framing of the subject being shot at eye level, and the subject holding her camera in all three photos.</p>

The intricate patterns and textures, along with the varying colors, highlight the scale of human extraction activities.</p><p>The final image, "Magado Crater #1, Kenya, 2017", showcases a multi colored lake in a crater, a natural formation used by local tribes for cattle watering and soda ash harvesting.</p>

		<p>He used leading lines and patterns of shapes to help bring these images, and thus his message to life. I would consider these good images due to their ability to show beauty hidden in plain view all this time. He offered a different perspective to stunning landscapes that most never see.</p><p>I think the effect of seeing several images together as a series is striking. When you see one it is interesting. Though, when you see them all together it is breathtaking.</p><p>The written information changes your understanding of the photos due to the photos’ more abstract nature. Because it’s not a common angle these shots are coming from, it necessitates the context to truly understand and appreciate these images more.</p>

I did this to show that trash isn’t the priority of the city though it is still there.</p><p>Though, for the other two, I used my phone to with a larger aperture of about an equivalent f15 to achieve little bokeh and get a better dynamic focus in the shot than could be achieved with my skills on a DLSR.</p>

		<p>In my photo series this semester I wanted to show a contrast in modern and older designs. This contrast in building design is with older buildings being made more of brick or concrete while modern design is more glass based buildings. In older cars they are more angular with brighter colours whilst new cars tend to be sleeker and of more muted colours like grey, black, and white.</p>

		<p>I want to shoot cars, buildings, and possibly fashion of older or modern contrasted by its surroundings. With buildings this could be an older building with a modern one next to it and showing the direct contrast. Though this can also be an old car in front of a modern building; same with the idea of fashion.</p>

		<p>My inspirations for this project include William Eggelston’s “Louisiana” due to its idea of putting the focus on something that we normally wouldn’t notice or see. This again in Jo Spence and Rosy Martin’s “Libido Uprising”. I love the harsh contrast that the image shows. I want to include a similar harsh contrast of obscure point of view that the view might have never seen about design.</p>

		<p>My three challenges I need to overcome include, finding areas where this contrast can occur, learn how to properly use Lightroom or similar programs to help achieve my vision for the images, and have patience in trying to gather these photos. Through achieving all of these three challenges, I can create a vibrant and bright series.</p>

		<p><b><u>Artist:</b></u> Daido Moriyama</p><p>The image employs high contrast lighting, with stark shadows and bright highlights that create a dramatic and intense visual effect. The light source appears to be positioned to the left of the subject and seems to be not diffused. This source of light is casting a deep shadow that accentuate the form and texture of the subject (Hat).</p><p>Light is used effectively to emphasize the contours and shapes within the image, particularly highlighting the curves and depressions on the hat. The relation between light and shadow adds depth, creating a three dimensional effect in the two dimensional medium of photography.</p><p>The mood is mysterious and intense due to the pronounced shadows and highlights; it evokes a sense of intrigue as viewers are drawn into exploring details revealed by light. It does this with a low aperture of possibly f2 f4, creating a large bokeh effect around the hat. In addition, his mood is helped by his strategic use of vignette around the whole image. This vignette effect on 35mm film can be achieved through dodge and burn in the darkroom</p><p>Concretely, this is an image of a hat with prominent lighting casting significant shadows which accentuate its shape.</p><p>Abstractly, this photo could be interpreted as an exploration of form and texture brought out through dramatic lighting; it transcends its subject of a hat to become an artwork focusing on visual elements like contrast, shape, and form. It captures the signature style of Daido Moriyama that transforms ordinary subjects into visually striking compositions in a perspective most would normally not see or focus on.</p>

		<p>My process in recreating the photo of a hat by Daido Moriyama was a little challenging. Not having the same hat as he used to challenge it a little bit. In addition, from the looks of the original photo, Moriyama used natural lighting, and as such I had to wait for the perfect time of day in which the light, coming into my room, hit the hat at a similar angle. Though, when I took this photo, I had to take it from the other direction due to the direction of light coming in.</p><p>I used a similar technique of dodge and burn that the Moriyama used, though digitally rather than in a dark room. I tried to make the main focus of the image only the hat and stray from a lot of distracting details similar to his techniques.</p>
