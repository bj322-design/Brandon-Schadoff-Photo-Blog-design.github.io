		<p><u><b>Gallery Questions:</u></b></p><p>Morayama's approach to photography is interesting. He often uses differing techniques of lack of color, cammera shake, and sharp imagry to express his subjects</p><p>The way in which he photographs people is unnatural in the photgraphy world. He tries to catch his subjects off guard by the looks of things. He expresses their shock and true emotions in his work.</p><p><u><b>Artist:</u> Daido Moriyama</b></p><p><b><u>Time Period:</u> 1974 New York</b></p><p>This photo depicts consumerism in the 1970s.</p><p>It does this by showing the contrast between the film camera operator of the CBS operator with the image of the feet Infront of the TV in a living room.</p><p>The focus of these two contrasting shots are clear. The first being the operator and the second being the feet of the person watching the TV from their home.</p><p> There is no clear message written with this work however I don’t think anymore context is needed to fully understand it. It is saying how easy it is to watch TV in the home and how relaxed the person is just watching it.</p><p> The style is different from anything I have seen before showing a clear depiction of the persons feet.</p>

		<p><u><b>Artist:</u> Daido Moriyama</b></p><p><b><u>Time Period:</u> 1972 To Present</b></p><p>This photo belongs to Daido Moriyama’s Record series, which he began in 1972 and continues today.</p><p>It depicts an ashy cigarette on a dirty ashtray, emphasizing the unglamorous and disgusting nature of smoking.</p><p>The focus of the image is sharp ultimately drawing your eyes to the dirty tray onto which the cigarette lies.</p><p>The image is simple and clear, conveying the artist’s message without needing more information. This image reminds me of the images I would expect to see in a health class in school to discourage smoking of children as they grow up.</p>
