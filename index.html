		<p><u><b>Gallery Questions:</u></b></p><p>Morayama's approach to photography is interesting. He often uses differing techniques of lack of color, camera shake, and sharp imagery to focus on his subjects</p><p>The way in which he photographs people is unnatural in the photgraphy world. He tries to catch his subjects off guard. He expresses their shock and true emotions in his work.</p><p><u><b>Artist:</u></b> Daido Moriyama</p><p><b><u>Time Period:</u></b> 1974 New York</p><p>This photo depicts how someone can work in TV devlopment and also enjoy it in their freetime</p><p>It does this by showing the contrast between the CBS camera operator with the image of the feet infront of a TV in a home.</p><p>The focus of these two contrasting shots is clear. The first being the operator and the second being the feet of the person watching the TV from their home.</p><p> I don’t think anymore context needed to fully understand it. This starkly contrasts with the experience of the individual who works in the TV industry but still finds pleasure in indulging in it.</p><p> The style is different from anything I have seen before showing a clear depiction of a persons feet.</p>

		<p><u><b>Artist:</u></b> Daido Moriyama</p><p><b><u>Time Period:</u></b> 1972 To Present</p><p>This photo belongs to Daido Moriyama’s Record series, which he began in 1972 and continues today.</p><p>It depicts an ashy cigarette on a dirty ashtray, emphasizing the unglamorous and disgusting nature of smoking.</p><p>The focus of the image is sharp ultimately drawing your eyes to the dirty tray onto which the cigarette lies.</p><p>The image is simple and clear, conveying the artist’s message without needing more information. This image reminds me of the images I would expect to see in a health class in school to discourage smoking of children as they grow up.</p>

		<p>I selected this initial photograph as it encapsulates a memorable moment from my first two weeks.</p><p>In the image, two of my friends and flatmates stand on the ice, while local boys playfully toss crystal clear ice chunks into the frozen pond at Regent Park.</p><p>This image holds significance for me because, shortly after stepping onto the ice, a diverse crowd—comprising of adults, children, and couples—gathered around us. Some joined in breaking the ice, while others glided across the small pond. This experience taught me that, regardless of our differences, we can all come together for moments of joy, transcending boundaries and fostering connections.</p>

		<p>The second photograph I have chosen is significant to me as it was a night I will never forget.</p><p>In walking down the streets of Soho with my friends, we stumbled upon a crowd of people outside of a new store. We asked a person from the crowd what was happening. They said they were having a party for a fashion store opening. The stranger turned out to have taken part in organizing it and invited us in, also being from New York he wanted to show us a night we won't forget.</p><p>They have turned basement into a nightclub with a DJ and dancing. It proved to me that you never know what is going to happen in this city.</p><p>This image depicts a woman dancing under the disco ball with neon pink and purple lights all around her. I tried to make the focus of the image not of the woman, but the disco ball she is under. I wanted to try and capture the emotions I felt in that moment: chaoticness, and estatic.</p>

		<p>The third image I've selected depicts a long exposure image of me on London Bridge at night.</p><p>Being from New York, I am accustomed to the intense energy that characterizes a bustling city. However, London offers a different emotion.</p><p>In this image, I stand as the central figure, holding my composure amidst the rapid movement of the world around me. London, I have found to be an overwhelming experience. Though it is a city that I have over these two weeks, learned to love for all its beauty.</p><p>I am extremely thankful to call this bustling city my home away from home for the semester, as it continues to surprise me with its unique blend of, culture, architecture, history, and charm.</p>

		<p><p><u><b>Artist:</u></b> Jo Spence and Rosy Martin</p><p><b><u>Time Period:</u></b> 1989</p><p>This series by Jo Spence and Rosy Martin named, “Libido Uprising”, features two images: one of Spence armed with a hoover, and another of her wearing fishnet stockings and heels with the vacuum tube coiled up her leg. The first image is symbolizing the role of a housewife while the second is symbolizing the role of a seductress.</p><p>The photographer has made several technical choices:</p><p>Framing: Each image is individually framed, isolating the two roles and emphasizing their distinctness.</p><p>Focus: The focus is on Spence and the hoover in both images, drawing attention to the roles she is performing.</p><p>POV: The point of view is straightforward, allowing the viewer to directly engage with the images.</p><p>Shapes: The shapes of the hoover and Spence’s body in different poses contribute to the narrative of each image.</p><p>Use of Light: The images are brightly colored, creating a stark contrast with the dark background and highlighting the subjects.</p><p>Use of Colour: The use of colour further emphasizes the contrast between the two roles Spence is portraying.</p><p>What unites these images as a series is the theme of challenging female stereotypes. Both images depict the same individual, Spence, performing two clichéd roles that women are often expected to fulfill: the housewife and the seductress. This juxtaposition of roles in the series provides a critique of societal expectations and norms. The use of the same prop, the hoover, in both images also unifies them, serving as a symbol of domesticity that is both embraced and subverted. The series is a powerful commentary on gender roles and societal expectations.</p>

		<p>All the three shots show a different emotion in the images not only in how the subject looks but also how we interact with and interpret the images and feelings from them. The subject stands out more in some – such as the “worm’s eye”. However, they seem to look smaller or rather ‘less powerful’ as stated prior in the “birds’ eye”.</p>

	<p><b1>Week 3: Paul Trevor’s <i>Brick Lane: The Turning Point</i></b1>
</div>
<div id = content>
	<div id = text>
		<p>This image was achieved through a wider aperture. The artist was most likely using a f5.6 due to having the foreground in focus while the background has a slight Bokeh effect.</p><p>In this image he was most likely using a 35mm film camera due to the shape of the image being more rectangular and time in which these images were taken. He is shooting this image just to the left of the speaker causing the debate. He used the arch of the people in the crowd to make your eye travel to the middle of the image then upwards towards the woman raising her hand in the crowd. The light in the image is overhead and behind the photographer due to the shadow of the people in the background of the image being darker while the people in the foreground are exposed properly.</p><p>I feel that the fact he took the photo having the people in the front seeming almost bored or annoyed whilst having the people in the back and middle seeming to be very interested in the debate leads to the overall message in many white people didn't want this change to occur in Britain. The people in the back and middle seem to be mainly minorities while the people in the front are mainly white.</p><p>In the collection the artist depicts events that documented the events and people affected by the Battle of Brick Lane. The abstract meaning in these images to me shows how hysteria and hate against minorities affects us all. This becomes plane to see when looking at the image depicted on the right or other images in his collection of minority protests, or the fearful face of the white man holding a rosary during a preaching on the street.</p><p>Throughout his collection Paul Trevor uses a wider aperture to focus on his subjects and further show his message. In addition, he showed some shots involving a slower shutter leading to light trails from boys running down an alley to show how fast these events were happening. The shapes in these images always have leading lines be it from the streets, buildings, or people depicted. These lines help to frame the image and make the subject more known to the viewer. I feel what unites these images is the determination on the people's faces throughout the images. The people depicted often didn't show fear and when they did it was in the face of the preacher wanting to stay to tradition.</p><p>I feel that the descriptions shown do change my option of the collection as from an outside perspective I can further put myself in the right mindset to understand the events occurring. Without them I would have still understood the message, however it becomes more defined and concrete.</p><p>This collection was successful due to showing the message the people wanted to get out to the world and show the oppression they faced. Without the collection the oppression might have never stopped how it did and might have been worse for all involved parties.</p>

Everything in this image is exposed and this is seen when looking in the background in which you can see another women sitting down as well detail in the room itself.</p>

		<p>In the first photo I wanted to create a cozy atmosphere. That is why I chose to shoot this one them with wood paneling in the background and with warmer light unlike the second image. In all three photos I tried to use a smaller aperture being no more than f6.3.</p><p>This first photo I wanted to create a standard portrait involving my partner. I wanted to make something you might think is a pleasing image with the subject smiling.</p>

		<p>I wanted to change the tone for the second and third images slightly. In the second image she is seen staring off at the window. She looks distraught and concerned. </p><p>She was quickly moving her head leading to a slight blur in her face and hair. I wanted to change the tone from a warmer tone to concerned.</p><p>I believe that photography can capture a moment and this moment for her was worried and concerned about getting this assignment done. A human worry that I felt I wanted to capture. This image is unique as the background is white with the light being a soft diffused light illumining her whole body evenly.</p>

		<p>This third image I chose uses a similar theme to the second image that is juxtaposed with the wood paneling. In this image, like the first, the lighting is very little from overhead the subject.</p><p>Her face is again concerned with a  slight smirk this time. This image is unlike the three because it paints the cozy theme as stated before with the darker theme of the second image, human concern. All three image are alike due to the framing of the subject being shot at eye level, and the subject holding her camera in all three photos.</p>

The intricate patterns and textures, along with the varying colors, highlight the scale of human extraction activities.</p><p>The final image, "Magado Crater #1, Kenya, 2017", showcases a multi colored lake in a crater, a natural formation used by local tribes for cattle watering and soda ash harvesting.</p>

		<p>He used leading lines and patterns of shapes to help bring these images, and thus his message to life. I would consider these good images due to their ability to show beauty hidden in plain view all this time. He offered a different perspective to stunning landscapes that most never see.</p><p>I think the effect of seeing several images together as a series is striking. When you see one it is interesting. Though, when you see them all together it is breathtaking.</p><p>The written information changes your understanding of the photos due to the photos’ more abstract nature. Because it’s not a common angle these shots are coming from, it necessitates the context to truly understand and appreciate these images more.</p>

I did this to show that trash isn’t the priority of the city though it is still there.</p><p>Though, for the other two, I used my phone to with a larger aperture of about an equivalent f15 to achieve little bokeh and get a better dynamic focus in the shot than could be achieved with my skills on a DLSR.</p>

		<p>In my photo series this semester I wanted to show a contrast in modern and older designs. This contrast in building design is with older buildings being made more of brick or concrete while modern design is more glass based buildings. In older cars they are more angular with brighter colours whilst new cars tend to be sleeker and of more muted colours like grey, black, and white.</p>

		<p>I want to shoot cars, buildings, and possibly fashion of older or modern contrasted by its surroundings. With buildings this could be an older building with a modern one next to it and showing the direct contrast. Though this can also be an old car in front of a modern building; same with the idea of fashion.</p>

		<p>My inspirations for this project include William Eggelston’s “Louisiana” due to its idea of putting the focus on something that we normally wouldn’t notice or see. This again in Jo Spence and Rosy Martin’s “Libido Uprising”. I love the harsh contrast that the image shows. I want to include a similar harsh contrast of obscure point of view that the view might have never seen about design.</p>

		<p>My three challenges I need to overcome include, finding areas where this contrast can occur, learn how to properly use Lightroom or similar programs to help achieve my vision for the images, and have patience in trying to gather these photos. Through achieving all of these three challenges, I can create a vibrant and bright series.</p>

	<p><b1>Week 8: Recreate The Photo</b1>
</div>
<div id = content>
	<div id = text>
		<p><b><u>Artist:</b></u> Daido Moriyama</p><p>The image employs high contrast lighting, with stark shadows and bright highlights that create a dramatic and intense visual effect. The light source appears to be positioned to the left of the subject and seems to be not diffused. This source of light is casting a deep shadow that accentuate the form and texture of the subject (Hat).</p><p>Light is used effectively to emphasize the contours and shapes within the image, particularly highlighting the curves and depressions on the hat. The relation between light and shadow adds depth, creating a three dimensional effect in the two dimensional medium of photography.</p><p>The mood is mysterious and intense due to the pronounced shadows and highlights; it evokes a sense of intrigue as viewers are drawn into exploring details revealed by light. It does this with a low aperture of possibly f2 f4, creating a large bokeh effect around the hat. In addition, his mood is helped by his strategic use of vignette around the whole image. This vignette effect on 35mm film can be achieved through dodge and burn in the darkroom</p><p>Concretely, this is an image of a hat with prominent lighting casting significant shadows which accentuate its shape.</p><p>Abstractly, this photo could be interpreted as an exploration of form and texture brought out through dramatic lighting; it transcends its subject of a hat to become an artwork focusing on visual elements like contrast, shape, and form. It captures the signature style of Daido Moriyama that transforms ordinary subjects into visually striking compositions in a perspective most would normally not see or focus on.</p>

		<p>My process in recreating the photo of a hat by Daido Moriyama was a little challenging. Not having the same hat as he used to challenge it a little bit. In addition, from the looks of the original photo, Moriyama used natural lighting, and as such I had to wait for the perfect time of day in which the light, coming into my room, hit the hat at a similar angle. Though, when I took this photo, I had to take it from the other direction due to the direction of light coming in.</p><p>I used a similar technique of dodge and burn that the Moriyama used, though digitally rather than in a dark room. I tried to make the main focus of the image only the hat and stray from a lot of distracting details similar to his techniques.</p>

	<p><b1>Week 8: Inpiration From An Artist</b1>
</div>
<div id = content>
	<div id = text>
		<p><b><u>Artist:</u></b> TODD HIDO</p><p>I was inspired by this image by Todd Hido to recreate this shot as I feel it creates an eery mood. The composition of the light seems to be coming from a lamp post on the street. I feel that this helps to mood and understanding of the image better.</p><p>The photo shows a street at night on a foggy night. I feel that this image is about the fear and beauty that one can experience on a dark road with no indication of what is to come next. That is why I felt I needed to recreate this image.</p>

		<p>When I went home to the US recently, I saw a similar view down my street. Using a DLSR camera an aperture of f8 and a shutter speed of ½ to allow for the image to be bright enough. In addition, it was shot at an iso of 800 with a 55mm lens on a tripod. This combination and a little colour grading allowed me to create a similar photo. Though, unlike Hido’s photo, I wanted to myself in the image. I wanted to express myself and thus the photographer in a manor that is not normally expressed.</p><p>I wanted stress how the silent photographer that is normally not shown exists. In addition I wanted express how I felt during this time; showing the figures or shadows that I felt followed me. I lost my grandmother at the start of this semester and that broke me. Being home brought back those feelings and this image I felt expressed it well.</p>

</div>
<div id = content>
	<div id = text>
		<p>Currently, I haven’t had that much time to go out on the Street of London and take a ton of Photographs. I have taken about 2 to 4 that I feel could fit my theme of contrasting new with old design.</p><p>These images have ranged from my recent trip to Paris: expressing the difference in the old city with the nearby new city. In addition, here in London I have taken some photos of newer cars with their sleek designs contrasted by the old buildings around them as well as an old scooter in a similar scenery contrasted with a newer scoter directly next to it.</p><p>I have plans to go out and explore the city taking photos, but I have been catching up on work and meeting family so plans had to change. From now on though, I am free to take photos of the city and continue the series.</p>

	<p><b1>Week 9: Bert Hardy Retrospective</b1>
</div>
<div id = content>
	<div id = text>
		<p>I choose this photo due to its contrast between landscape and soldiers on the hill. The focus is sharp, and the contrast is balanced throughout the entire image. The composition is showing the soldiers of the Greek Civil War.</p><p>The effect of these all combined helps to further stress how high they are relative to the bottom of the valley and how they have no fear waiting for the enemy.</p><p>I feel that this photo shows its message well and I feel that the use of the caption only helps to further guide the viewer to that message: fighting for their cause whole heartedly. I feel that you don’t need to view the series to get this message.</p><p>I think that every photo he portrayed helped to convey this message. Viewing the series only enhances it but is not necessary. This image reminded me of the movie Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. It did this through its high perspective looking down at the valley in the scenes when they are fighting the WW1 tanks.</p>

		<p>I choose this photo due to its differing message from what you see and what you read from the caption. The focus of this image is sharp, and the contrast is balanced in the foreground, but the background gets cutoff the further out you look. Its message is showing ordinary life in an extraordinary way.</p><p>The photo however, for me was primarily showing a young boy climbing a large hill with his mother. If I didn’t read this caption, I would have never known that this boy was climbing out of a bombsite with his mother in Birmingham England in 1951. The style is unlike anything I can recall. The foreground mixed with the background is unique to anything I can think of.</p>

		<p>I choose this photo due to is dramatic looking subject. The focus of this image like the rest of Hardy’s image was sharp and the composition held the subject in the middle of the image. The contrast, just like the bombsite image, had a sharp contrast in the foreground but the further out you look the more detail is lost.</p><p>I feel that this image achieves the message of showing the power that a farmer has in everyday life well. I feel this is the message as he put the light behind the farmer and tried to paint him in almost angelic light and entrance. I don’t think you need to read the caption of this image to understand the message as the caption only says “Farmer, September 1951, Douro Valley, Portugal”.</p><p>I don’t think you need to view the photo with the series as a whole to understand its message. I think it is able to stand alone or with the series. The style of this photo reminds me of biblical images of angles coming down to Earth due to the harsh backlight on the subject and the fuzziness at the bottom of his feet from the dust, looking almost like fog.</p>

		<p>In Bert Hardy’s series of War Photography are all about showing the solders during the war either in combat or involved in the crimes against the nazi’s during the end of WW2. This series was taken across the Korean war, WW2, Greek Civil war, and conflicts in Southeast Asia. </p><p>The message behind them I feel was to show that the soldiers fighting were people. They were fighting for a message they truly believed in as shown in the pictures of the Greek soldiers and during the Korean war photos. I know this because the captions during the exhibition was showing the side he was on.</p></p>

		<p>I wanted to show in this small series the everyday life of a Londoner. I wanted to start from the possible beginning of the day to possible end of the day. In the image of the underground station, and throughout this series I wanted to express colour in a different way. The colour focus throughout the series was to show how people only focus on the small things in their day to day and the world around them. Head down and walking from A to B.</p>

		<p>Image two shows the Tesco Meal deal section. Lunch time this is always the liveliest parts of the store. People don’t often get their lunch from a restaurant but grab and go here at Tesco being only 3.40 pounds for a full meal. In this image I wanted to not show the people or the food as much in this image but the actual reason they come here. Being creatures of habit, many often repeat the same thing day after day with no real goal for the day apart from getting through it.</p>

		<p>The third image shows how many people in London end their day, in the Pub. Just like image two, I didn’t want to show the surroundings or even the people in the pub, but the reason they come, to enjoy a beer with a friend. In each of these images I tried to highlight a different colour of significance to the Londoner. Red and blue for tube to start the day, yellow for lunch with the meal deal at Tesco, and Orange for a beer at the end of the day.</p>

	<p><b1>Week 10: Wilfred Ukpong (Afrofuturism)</b1>
</div>
<div id = content>
	<div id = text>
		<p>The most striking thing for me about this image is the contrast in colours. The red pontoon juxtaposed with the people with black paint and the bright water with the beach stands out a lot. I think the use of colour is very intentional in the eyes of the photographer and it draws the views eye directly towards the boat and subjects that sit upon it. I don’t believe that this work is successful in his message of wanting to inspire environmental and societal change in the Niger delta.</p><p>The message of the image is lost with the use of many subjects in this case. I feel that there is no hint of what he believes is wrong here. I see a powerful image of teamwork and companionship rather than oppression. This image reminds me of Norman Parkinson’s 1975 Vogue images with its odd posture of the subject and stark use of contrast and light to highlight the subjects as well as colour to further ensure that they stand out.</p>

		<p>The second image is striking again through its use of colour but also dark background. The image is further enforced by the caption on showing that bearing a child in the Nigar delta is a symbol of hope through the phrase “By and by, I Will Carry This Burden of Hope, Till the Laments of my Child is Heard #1”. I think this helps to change the image from almost demonic with the red paint on the subjects to one of power and hope.</p><p>The subject in the middle almost looks like a powerful leader, guiding her people into a new age through her child; depicted in black paint with a red blanket comforting the child. I believe that this image is successful but in the idea that the people of Nigar are wanting to gain power over the oppressors and help rebuild their future through the new generation.</p><p>This image reminds me at first of biblical demonic imagery but under further inspection reminds me of surrealist art. Specifically that of Salvador Dali with its use of harsh contrasting colours distorting reality to the artists’ desired image.</p>

		<p>The last image I choose to investigate is striking due to its juxtaposition again through colour but also its use of another image of almost power and sadness in the series against hopeful and cheerful beach backdrop. It suggests another layer to the narrative that the artist is holding back for the viewer to investigate.</p><p>The caption of “The Advent of the Visionaries – A Screen to Behold” suggests that the image the two men are carrying is the message, or rather that their visionary (the woman in the frame) is their saviour or message holder. I think this image is harder to decipher its message and without that caption it would not be as successful.</p><p>That being said I believe, that it does the job of showing the hope and power that the Nigar people hold for their return to their old ways of life. Though, I feel that it is lost by putting that within an image that is already in the series that shows this power. And as such it is not successful for me.</p><p>This photo reminds me of René Magritte’s works. He often used similar techniques to create images that challenge our perceptions of reality. He put images inside of others and objects that shouldn’t belong in the normal activities to help drive his messages. That is what I feel Ukpong did in this image.</p>

</div>
<div id = content>
	<div id = text>
		<p>Some of the choices I made when creating this image include the use of bright light from the windows while keeping almost everything visible to the viewer. I tried to use a large aperture to help further keep everything in frame to try and show the royalty of the subject and the modesty she possesses.</p><p>I wanted to try and provide the message that everyone is important or royal if they believe so. I tried to exaggerate the colours and light coming out of the windows to paint an almost angelic effect upon the subject and room in which she walks into. If you look to the right of the subject the lights are still on and bright creating a strange mood in which the viewer doesn’t know if it is morning or dusk in the room in which the subject walks.</p><p>I also photographed the subject from the back to try and show that it doesn’t matter what you look like or how you dress but the subject is holding herself straight and powerful in a confident manner helping to further my message. The reason I used a large depth of field to keep everything in focus was to show the room in which she stood. I wanted to express how it looked like a palace where a person of power could stay.</p>

		<p>My use of crop here changes the image as in losing the large ceiling you are brought closer to the subject and further can see the light that is flooding the room. Instead of seeing the subject from a distance you are up close and personal with her. Without the distractions of the room on the left of the subject you can tell how bright the room is now and how stark the colour pop is when looking at the wall the subject is facing.</p>

</div>
<div id = content>
	<div id = text>
		<p>My photo series was initially generalized. I had the initial plan on comparing different objects of old design – cars, buildings, general objects – to their modern counterparts and to each other.</p><p>The feedback I received from my professor during my week 11 update presentation taught me that this wouldn’t work. I presented five different photos one of which was acceptable. The reason that this didn’t work is because there wasn’t a clear link between the photos. There was no similar shapes, lines, or colours.</p><p>After talking with the professor, I decided to focus on the initially successful photo’s theme of comparing modern vs old design in architecture building in London.</p><p>Some of my 5 photos were taken in New York, Paris, and London. However, this seemed to be convolute the series and tended to form a disjoined theme and message. In making this more streamlined approach it helped me create a better connection in my photos through leading lines and the Fibonacci sequence.</p><p>I also learned that I would be encouraged to use at least two other photographers that were not mentioned in class and at least one other work such as art, literature, or music as inpiration to help create a better overall message and series.</p>
