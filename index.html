		<p><u><b>Gallery Questions:</u></b></p><p>Morayama's approach to photography is interesting. He often uses differing techniques of lack of color, cammera shake, and sharp imagry to express his subjects</p><p>The way in which he photographs people is unnatural in the photgraphy world. He tries to catch his subjects off guard by the looks of things. He expresses their shock and true emotions in his work.</p><p><u><b>Artist:</u> Daido Moriyama</b></p><p><b><u>Time Period:</u> 1974 New York</b></p><p>This photo depicts consumerism in the 1970s.</p><p>It does this by showing the contrast between the film camera operator of the CBS operator with the image of the feet Infront of the TV in a living room.</p><p>The focus of these two contrasting shots are clear. The first being the operator and the second being the feet of the person watching the TV from their home.</p><p> There is no clear message written with this work however I don’t think anymore context is needed to fully understand it. It is saying how easy it is to watch TV in the home and how relaxed the person is just watching it.</p><p> The style is different from anything I have seen before showing a clear depiction of the persons feet.</p>

		<p><u><b>Artist:</u> Daido Moriyama</b></p><p><b><u>Time Period:</u> 1972 To Present</b></p><p>This photo belongs to Daido Moriyama’s Record series, which he began in 1972 and continues today.</p><p>It depicts an ashy cigarette on a dirty ashtray, emphasizing the unglamorous and disgusting nature of smoking.</p><p>The focus of the image is sharp ultimately drawing your eyes to the dirty tray onto which the cigarette lies.</p><p>The image is simple and clear, conveying the artist’s message without needing more information. This image reminds me of the images I would expect to see in a health class in school to discourage smoking of children as they grow up.</p>

		<p>I selected this initial photograph as it encapsulates a memorable moment from my first two weeks.</p><p>In the image, two of my friends and flatmates stand on the ice, while local boys playfully toss crystal clear ice chunks into the frozen pond at Regent Park.</p><p>This image holds significance for me because, shortly after stepping onto the ice, a diverse crowd—comprising adults, children, and couples—gathered around us. Some joined in breaking the ice, while others glided across the small pond, revealing a universal truth: irrespective of age, background, or beliefs, we share a common humanity. This experience taught me that, regardless of our differences, we can all come together for moments of joy, transcending boundaries and fostering connections.</p>

		<p>The second photograph I have chosen is significant to me as it was a night I will never forget.</p><p>In walking down, the streets of Soho with my friends, we stumbled upon a crowd of people on the street all outside of one store that just opened with no images on the outside. Upon investigating by asking a stranger, they were having a party for a fashion store opening. The stranger turned out to have taken part in organizing it and allowed us in, also being from New York he wanted to show us a night we won't forget for the best reasons.</p><p>On the top floor was a shop whilst the basement was turned into a nightclub, with a DJ, and dancing. It proved to me that you never know what is going to happen in this city.</p><p>This image depicts a women dancing under the disco ball with neon pink and purple lights all around her. I tried to make the focus of the image not of the woman, but the disco ball she is under. I wanted to try and capture the emotions I felt in that moment: chaoticness, and estatic.</p>

		<p>The third image I've selected depicts a long exposure image of me on London Bridge at night.</p><p>Being from New York, I am accustomed to the intense energy that characterizes a bustling city. However, London offers a distinct ambiance.</p><p>In this image, I stand as the central figure, holding my composure amidst the rapid movement of the world around me. London, I have found to be an overwhelming experience. Though it is a city that I have over these two weeks, learned to love for all its beauty and faults.</p><p>I am extremely thankful to call this bustling city my home away from home for the semester, as it continues to surprise me with its unique blend of old fashion ways, culture, architecture, history, and charm.</p>
