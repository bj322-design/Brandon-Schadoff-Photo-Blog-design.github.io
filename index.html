<p><u>Week 1</u></p>
<img class = gear src="images/week1.jpg">
<p><u>Artist:</u> Daido Moriyama</p><p>Time Period: 1974 New York</p><p>This photo depicts consumerism in the 1970s.</p><p>It does this by showing the contrast between the film camera operator of the CBS operator with the image of the feet Infront of the TV in a living room.</p><p>The focus of these two contrasting shots are clear. The first being the operator and the second being the feet of the person watching the TV from their home.</p><p> There is no clear message written with this work however I donâ€™t think anymore context is needed to fully understand it. It is saying how easy it is to watch TV in the home and how relaxed the person is just watching it.</p><p> The style is different from anything I have seen before showing a clear depiction of the persons feet.<br><br><br><br></p>
