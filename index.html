		<p><u><b>Gallery Questions:</u></b></p><p>Morayama's approach to photography is interesting. He often uses differing techniques of lack of color, camera shake, and sharp imagery to focus on his subjects</p><p>The way in which he photographs people is unnatural in the photgraphy world. He tries to catch his subjects off guard. He expresses their shock and true emotions in his work.</p><p><u><b>Artist:</u></b> Daido Moriyama</p><p><b><u>Time Period:</u></b> 1974 New York</p><p>This photo depicts how someone can work in TV devlopment and also enjoy it in their freetime</p><p>It does this by showing the contrast between the CBS camera operator with the image of the feet infront of a TV in a home.</p><p>The focus of these two contrasting shots is clear. The first being the operator and the second being the feet of the person watching the TV from their home.</p><p> I don’t think anymore context needed to fully understand it. This starkly contrasts with the experience of the individual who works in the TV industry but still finds pleasure in indulging in it.</p><p> The style is different from anything I have seen before showing a clear depiction of a persons feet.</p>

		<p><u><b>Artist:</u></b> Daido Moriyama</p><p><b><u>Time Period:</u></b> 1972 To Present</p><p>This photo belongs to Daido Moriyama’s Record series, which he began in 1972 and continues today.</p><p>It depicts an ashy cigarette on a dirty ashtray, emphasizing the unglamorous and disgusting nature of smoking.</p><p>The focus of the image is sharp ultimately drawing your eyes to the dirty tray onto which the cigarette lies.</p><p>The image is simple and clear, conveying the artist’s message without needing more information. This image reminds me of the images I would expect to see in a health class in school to discourage smoking of children as they grow up.</p>

		<p>I selected this initial photograph as it encapsulates a memorable moment from my first two weeks.</p><p>In the image, two of my friends and flatmates stand on the ice, while local boys playfully toss crystal clear ice chunks into the frozen pond at Regent Park.</p><p>This image holds significance for me because, shortly after stepping onto the ice, a diverse crowd—comprising of adults, children, and couples—gathered around us. Some joined in breaking the ice, while others glided across the small pond. This experience taught me that, regardless of our differences, we can all come together for moments of joy, transcending boundaries and fostering connections.</p>

		<p>The second photograph I have chosen is significant to me as it was a night I will never forget.</p><p>In walking down the streets of Soho with my friends, we stumbled upon a crowd of people outside of a new store. We asked a person from the crowd what was happening. They said they were having a party for a fashion store opening. The stranger turned out to have taken part in organizing it and invited us in, also being from New York he wanted to show us a night we won't forget.</p><p>They have turned basement into a nightclub with a DJ and dancing. It proved to me that you never know what is going to happen in this city.</p><p>This image depicts a woman dancing under the disco ball with neon pink and purple lights all around her. I tried to make the focus of the image not of the woman, but the disco ball she is under. I wanted to try and capture the emotions I felt in that moment: chaoticness, and estatic.</p>

		<p>The third image I've selected depicts a long exposure image of me on London Bridge at night.</p><p>Being from New York, I am accustomed to the intense energy that characterizes a bustling city. However, London offers a different emotion.</p><p>In this image, I stand as the central figure, holding my composure amidst the rapid movement of the world around me. London, I have found to be an overwhelming experience. Though it is a city that I have over these two weeks, learned to love for all its beauty.</p><p>I am extremely thankful to call this bustling city my home away from home for the semester, as it continues to surprise me with its unique blend of, culture, architecture, history, and charm.</p>

		<p><p><u><b>Artist:</u></b> Amirali Ghasemi</p><p><b><u>Time Period:</u></b> 2005 Iran</p><p>In Amirali Ghasemi's photograph named "Parties", shows the juxtaposition of private and public lives as a key compositional aspect.</p><p>The artwork captures young Iranian women dancing in their homes. This is contrasting intimate moments with the public persona dictated by societal norms of the time in Iran.</p><p>The framing of this photo isolates this moment, offering a glimpse into hidden lives and emphasizing the contrast with societal expectations of their culture.</p><p>The shapes of the women's movements, especially the dynamic poses of individuals, convey a sense of freedom and expression.</p>

		<p><p><u><b>Artist:</u></b> Jo Spence and Rosy Martin</p><p><b><u>Time Period:</u></b> 1989</p><p>This series by Jo Spence and Rosy Martin named, “Libido Uprising”, features two images: one of Spence armed with a hoover, and another of her wearing fishnet stockings and heels with the vacuum tube coiled up her leg. The first image is symbolizing the role of a housewife while the second is symbolizing the role of a seductress.</p><p>The photographer has made several technical choices:</p><p>Framing: Each image is individually framed, isolating the two roles and emphasizing their distinctness.</p><p>Focus: The focus is on Spence and the hoover in both images, drawing attention to the roles she is performing.</p><p>POV: The point of view is straightforward, allowing the viewer to directly engage with the images.</p><p>Shapes: The shapes of the hoover and Spence’s body in different poses contribute to the narrative of each image.</p><p>Use of Light: The images are brightly colored, creating a stark contrast with the dark background and highlighting the subjects.</p><p>Use of Colour: The use of colour further emphasizes the contrast between the two roles Spence is portraying.</p><p>What unites these images as a series is the theme of challenging female stereotypes. Both images depict the same individual, Spence, performing two clichéd roles that women are often expected to fulfill: the housewife and the seductress. This juxtaposition of roles in the series provides a critique of societal expectations and norms. The use of the same prop, the hoover, in both images also unifies them, serving as a symbol of domesticity that is both embraced and subverted. The series is a powerful commentary on gender roles and societal expectations.</p>
