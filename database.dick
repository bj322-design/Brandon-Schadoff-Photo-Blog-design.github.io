The-second-photograph-I-have-chosen-is-significant-to-me-as-it-was-a-night-I-will-never-forget.</p>
<p>In-walking-down-the-streets-of-Soho-with-my-friends,-we-stumbled-upon-a-crowd-of-people-outside-of-a-new-store.-We-asked-a-person-from-the-crowd-what-was-happening.-They-said-they-were-having-a-party-for-a-fashion-store-opening.-The-stranger-turned-out-to-have-taken-part-in-organizing-it-and-invited-us-in,-also-being-from-New-York-he-wanted-to-show-us-a-night-we-won't-forget.</p>
<p>They-have-turned-basement-into-a-nightclub-with-a-DJ-and-dancing.-It-proved-to-me-that-you-never-know-what-is-going-to-happen-in-this-city.</p>
<p>This-image-depicts-a-woman-dancing-under-the-disco-ball-with-neon-pink-and-purple-lights-all-around-her.-I-tried-to-make-the-focus-of-the-image-not-of-the-woman,-but-the-disco-ball-she-is-under.-I-wanted-to-try-and-capture-the-emotions-I-felt-in-that-moment:-chaoticness,-and-estatic.

The-third-image-I've-selected-depicts-a-long-exposure-image-of-me-on-London-Bridge-at-night.</p>
<p>Being-from-New-York,-I-am-accustomed-to-the-intense-energy-that-characterizes-a-bustling-city.-However,-London-offers-a-different-emtion.</p>
<p>In-this-image,-I-stand-as-the-central-figure,-holding-my-composure-amidst-the-rapid-movement-of-the-world-around-me.-London,-I-have-found-to-be-an-overwhelming-experience.-Though-it-is-a-city-that-I-have-over-these-two-weeks,-learned-to-love-for-all-its-beauty.</p>
<p>I-am-extremely-thankful-to-call-this-bustling-city-my-home-away-from-home-for-the-semester,-as-it-continues-to-surprise-me-with-its-unique-blend,-culture,-architecture,-history,-and-charm.
